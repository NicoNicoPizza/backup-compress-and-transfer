# backup-compress-and-transfer
Script for backing up and transfering files which can be used in the Windows Task Scheduler



You can create a task in the Task Scheduler. This task will execute the .bat script, sort of like using crontab on Linux.
You can export the task and it will create a .xml file you can use to import the task into other machines.
